# Object Data for Celestial Compass
This folder will be stored on a local SD card and used to store the required information to point to each celestial object. Each file name will be the name of the object (ex. "Jupiter", "Polaris", "Andromeda", etc.) and the first line of text will tell the program what kind of information is stored in the file.
