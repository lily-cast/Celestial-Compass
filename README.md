# The Celestial Compass
The Celestial Compass is a large scale project I hope to develop throughout the following years. It is based off of an idea I had of a device that would point swiveling arms towards various stars and planets in the sky. By tracking the location and orientation of the device, it is possible to use astronomical data to pin point the apparent position of almost anything in the sky. While the original idea for this project started as a table sized device, I am working on smaller versions of the device in order to prototype the mechanics before moving onto the full scale version. The current iteration is expected to be about 7-8 inches in diameter and is meant to be a sort of desk decoration device. This repository will host the code that will be used for all versions of the device as well as detail some of the design choices made along the way. At this point in time I do not plan to include the CAD files for any of the devices.

## The Mechanics
The central design of the celestial compass is achieved by rotating a pair of concentric rings that are able to provide two degrees of freedom to move a single point across a hemispherical area. (TODO: add image) These two degrees of freedom would be called φ and θ when using a spherical coordinate system, but in the context of astronomy these are called the azimuth and altitude respectively. ![spherical coordinate system](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/4f/3D_Spherical.svg)

By moving the bevel gear on the inside of the two arms, the gear attached to the outside arm will pivot, changing the altitude of the point. By moving both arms together, the azimuth of the point will be changed. The key here is that it is only the relative motion of the two arms that generate changes in the altitude. 

## The Code
The main concept of this project is centered around the relative motion of the two gears, but that will arguably be the easiest part of the project. The harder part will be figuring out exactly where to look in the sky. The easiest way to obtain the location of objects would be to ask some sort of API to grab them for me, but for the smaller version of this project, it will be more desirable to model this information without the need to access any sort of internet connection. This can be done by using mathematical models for the planets in our solar system and for the objects that don't move relative to the rest of the celestial sphere, I can just grab their right asscension and inclination and store those for later access. This does mean that the desktop version of this project will not be able to access any real time data for things such as satellites and aircraft, which is something I hope the full scale version will be able to do.

The desktop version will be running off of a raspberry pi pico and will be coded using C++
